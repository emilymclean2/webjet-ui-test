# Libraries

- [Ant design](https://ant.design/) was used for some components, as I wanted to try a new React component library that I haven't tried before
- [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) was used for styling components, as it's my preferred method
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) was used for icons as it has a huge library
- [react-simple-star-rating](https://github.com/awran5/react-simple-star-rating) was used for the quality rating as the icons were customisable.

I've also included screenshots from the designs of the Webjet logo and the advertisement, so that the working example is closer to the designs.
